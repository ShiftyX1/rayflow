# server/

Authoritative game simulation layer.

Planned contents:
- Match loop (fixed tick)
- World + rules (BedWars)
- Action validation
- Replication outputs (snapshots/events)
- Transport-agnostic connection handling

Note: server code is intentionally introduced incrementally during the migration stages.
